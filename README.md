# zaphoxx-uhf-rfid
uhf-rfid reader based on two TI1101 modules and an Arduino Due

This is a new, updated version of zuhf-rfid. Instead of having to install Arduino libraries the whole downloaded zipfile can be just moved into a Arduino working directory. The functionality is basically the same as before with a few minor changes and enhancements.
